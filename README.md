# MWI Transmutation Calculator

## Overview
The transmutation calculator is a small web application designed to provide a quick way to plan how many items are necessary to achieve a transmutation goal.

It uses the itemDetailsDict taken directly from the game as of 04/24/2025.

There are two modes. One takes a starting item and gives data about the probably output. The other takes a target item and gives data about the probable required input.

Hosted using [Github Pages](https://zandlight.github.io/mwi-transmutation-calculator/). Made as a first experiment with using Copilot for fast scaffolding.
